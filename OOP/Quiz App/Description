Implementation of a 'Question and Answer' Quiz, using a graphical user interface in Qt

Short description:
   The information about the questions is in a text file. Each Question has an id, a text,
 the correct answer, and a score. These are read when the application starts and are also stored
 in the file by the program.
   Another file contains information about the participants. Each Participant has a name and a score.
 The initial sore is 0 for each participant.
   When the application is launched, a new window is created for the presenter and also one for each participant.
   The window of the presenter will show all the questions with their id, text, correct answer and 
 associated score, sorted by id.
   The windows of the participants will show all the questions with their id, text and 
 associated score, sorted descending by score.
   Only the presenter can add questions, by inputting the question's id, text and correct answer and
 pressing a button 'Add'. This operation fails if the text is empty or if there is another question with
 the same id. The user will be informed if the operation fails.
   The participants can answer questions, by selecting the question, inputting the answer in a text edit
 and pressing a button 'Answer':
      -> A participant cannot answer the same question twice. When a question is answered, it will have a 
      green background in the participant's list and when clicking it, the 'Answer' button will be disabled.
      -> The score of each participant is shown in its window. When a question was answered correctly, the
      score of the participant increases by the score of the question that was answered.
    When a modification is made by the presenter, all the participants will see the modified list of questions.
