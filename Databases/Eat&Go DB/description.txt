 -Short description about Eat&Go Database-

The fast food restaurant has several employees, each one having a certain role(manager, cook, waiter).
For each employee the following data is stored: first name, last name, phone number, address and an 
email (optionally). CV of each employee is also stored in the database.

The customers of the restaurant can place one or more orders. An order is taken by one of the employees,
who registers the first name, last name and the phone number of the customer and also the date and 
time of the order. An order contains one or more products. Each product has a name, a price, a type
(main course, garnish, dessert, drink etc.) and, eventually, a description. A product/dish can be 
made by one or more ingredients. The ingredients are procured from different suppliers, for each
delivery a list for an ingredient is brought by a delivery man. The list contains the quantity, date
of delivery and date of expiring (if it's the case) of the ingredient.
