Partial implementation of Achi Game (console-based user interface).

Game description:
  The game is played by two players using a 3x3 board. Each player has 4 pieces that they place on the board. 
The game is won by the player who first lines up 3 of their own pieces into a line, column or diagonal. 
The game has two phases: placement and movement. The game rules are detailed as follows:
    When the program is started, it displays an empty board.
    The placement phase begins. The human (playing X) and computer (playing O) players take turns into placing 
  their pieces on the board. Pieces can only be placed on an unoccupied square. The computer does not allow the player to win during placement.
    If one of the players wins during placement, the game ends. Otherwise, it continues with the movement phase.
    The movement phase of the game begins. The players take turns moving one of their own pieces into the unoccupied square.
  Pieces can be moved only to a square that is adjacent on a row, column or diagonally. The movement phase continues until 
  one of the players wins. The computer may move randomly. However it must recognize and make an instant win move, if available.
