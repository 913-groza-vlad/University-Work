The persistance of the application is preserved by using a remote server and a local database, 
so the app is available both online and offline. 
When the app is online (connected to a server), the data for listing our entities is taken from the
server and the updates made in the list of activities are immediatelly synchronized with our db.

When the application is offline, the CRUD operations work in the following way:
 - create: the input will be saved in the local database and, when the device is able to connect to the server, the created entries will be pushed
 - read: the activities from the local database will be displayed, being notified that there is no server connection
 - update: the changes performed on the fields of an activity are saved in the local db, and the updates made will be synchronized with the server when device is back online
 - delete: the operation is not available offline, so a message will be displayed to announce the user of its unavailability

When the application is back online, the changes on the local database are sent to the server.
